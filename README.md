### 🧠 About Me

I'm a data analyst with a background in environmental sciences.  
I focus on turning raw data into **actionable insights** and clear **visual stories**.  

My learning journey started with self-initiated projects like bike-sharing trend analysis,  
and grew into a solid understanding of machine learning workflows and data-driven thinking.  

I'm currently exploring:

- 📈 Predictive modeling (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- 📍 Geospatial visualization with Folium & Plotly  
- 📊 Interactive dashboards using Streamlit  
- 🧪 Clean code + reproducibility in analysis

### 🚀 Projects

Here are some things I've built recently:

- [**Ethereum Dashboard**](https://github.com/Gokcisan/ethereum-dashboard)  
  *Streamlit app combining Ethereum price data & scraped news headlines, stored in SQLite DBs.*  

- [**Wine Quality Analysis**](https://github.com/Gokcisan/wine-quality-analysis)  
  *EDA + ML models on the classic wine quality dataset to uncover chemical features driving wine ratings.*  

- [**Shadow Calendar Matcher**](https://github.com/Gokcisan/pdm-shadow-calendar)  
  *TF-IDF text processing app turning raw “shadow calendar” logs into structured ERP-ready tasks.*
