### 🧠 About Me

I'm a data analyst with a background in environmental sciences and operations.  
I enjoy uncovering patterns, building models, and visualizing data to make better decisions.  

My learning journey started with self-initiated projects like bike-sharing trend analysis,  
and grew into a solid understanding of machine learning workflows and data-driven thinking.  

I'm currently exploring:

- 📈 Predictive modeling (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- 📍 Geospatial data visualization with Folium & Plotly
- 📊 Interactive dashboards using Streamlit
- 🧪 Clean code + reproducibility in analysis

### 🚀 Projects

Here are some things I've built or explored recently:

- [DC Bike Share EDA Dashboard](https://github.com/Gokcisan/dc-bike-share-analysis)  
  *Exploratory data analysis + visual dashboard of bike rental behavior in Washington DC.*

- [Ride Count Prediction Models](https://github.com/Gokcisan/dc-bike-share-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/03_ML_Modeling_RF_XGB.ipynb)  
  *Machine learning regression models (Random Forest & XGBoost) to predict bike ride volumes.*
